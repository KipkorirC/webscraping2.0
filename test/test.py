In this example test, we're testing a WebScraper class that has a method called scrape_website() which takes a URL as input and returns some information about the website in a dictionary format.

The setUp() method is called before each test case, and it creates an instance of the WebScraper class.

The first test case, test_scrape_website(), tests whether the scraper can retrieve the correct information from a website. It sets a valid URL and the expected output, and then calls the scrape_website() method with the URL. Finally, it asserts that the actual output is equal to the expected output.

The second test case, test_invalid_url(), tests if the scraper raises an error when given an invalid URL. It sets an invalid URL, and then uses the assertRaises() method to check if an exception is raised when the scrape_website() method is called with that URL.

The third test case, test_empty_url(), tests if the scraper raises an error when given an empty URL. It sets an empty URL, and then uses the assertRaises() method to check if an exception is raised when the scrape_website() method is called with that URL.

The fourth test case, test_output_format(), tests if the scraper returns output in the expected format. It sets a valid URL and the expected output in a dictionary format, and then calls the scrape_website() method with the URL. Finally, it asserts that the actual output is equal to the expected output dictionary.
